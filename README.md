## NLP-Open-QA-Project

This is a Context Based Open-Domain Question Answering system.
When given a context, and asked a question pertaining to it, the system
can provide accurate answers in the form of text / phrases.

The system uses BERT-base-uncased model for representations of tokens in (context, question) pairs 

The work is based on the paper: [Reading Wikipedia to answer Open domain Questions] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051) 

The dataset used for training the system is Stanford Question Answering Dataset [SQuAD] (https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)
